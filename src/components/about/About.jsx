                We are a team of young enthusiasts on a mission to transform the
                sneakerhead culture in Bulgaria. Our goal? To build a tight-knit
                and passionate community where people can share their love for
                sneakers, street fashion, and everything in between. We are the
                first to bring the SneakerCon experience to Bulgaria! The road
                ahead is long, but with your support, we can make it happen. Are
                you ready to be part of history?
