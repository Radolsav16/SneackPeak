                Our goal is to establish a streetwear market at least twice a year within the next two years, while also
            supporting local brands in Bulgaria. Sneakpeak is not a business; it is a cultural event that combines fashion,
            music, entertainment, and prizes. Our team will continue to develop the idea because we, too, strongly long for
            events like this.
